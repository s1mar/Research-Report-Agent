# Research SWEN 746 : Agent modeling paradigm and it's coordination/interaction aspects
You can access the presentation slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQrut-TP_TZIyO7ijknVmcbqRCHVkd0u8MMRp4VqThyYqtw2IsiXb5umMj-yT-5NES5frmm1g8lHuDC/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000). You can dowload my survey paper from the repo.

### My intentions for choosing this subject
Agent-based modeling and the coordination aspects of it, that is what I have chosen as my topic for Research. The primary reason being, growing as a developer, I started relating and modeling my code entities like living sentient beings, interacting and coordinating together to bring about the outcome that the user wants. Now in Software Engineering MS, I’ve come to realize that this actually is a paradigm and there is a decent amount of study into it, yet it’s comparatively young as compared to something
like the OO modeling paradigm. Mr.Michael Coen, the creator of SodaBot at the MIT AI lab puts it as, "Software agents are programs that engage in dialogs, negotiate and coordinate transfer of information." it has a radical ring to it but it highlights the “autonomy” aspects of this paradigm, though I reckon it warrants further investigation
and discovery.
